This research seeks to examine best practice in the field of digital editions by collating relevant evidence in a detailed catalogue of extant digital projects. The editions included in the Catalogue come from numerous sources and their selection follows basic criteria: the electronic texts can be ongoing or complete projects, born-digital editions or electronic reproductions of print volumes.

As of 2016, the [Austrian Centre for Digital Humanities](https://acdh.oeaw.ac.at/acdh/) is developing a [web application](https://github.com/acdh-oeaw/dig_ed_cat) for an interactive and user-friendly experience of the Catalogue.

The [RIDE Journal for Digital Editions and Resources](http://ride.i-d-e.de/) publishes reviews of digital editions (German and English).
